# ML - Pentest | Malware detector are robust?

This is a software framework that can be used for the evaluation of the robustness of Malware Detection methods with respect to adversarial attacks. Currently, there is a focus on black-box adversarial attacks on PE malware detector.

## Included Attacks

* **GAMMA**, formulated by [Demetrio et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13526), with section injection and API injection manipulations. Some code is reused from the open-source repository [secml-malware](https://github.com/pralab/secml_malware).
* **GAMMA V2**, introducted in this work. Is an augmented version of GAMMA that optimize the section injection position, the section characteristics and the section names.
