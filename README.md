# ML - Pentest | Are malware detector robust?

This is a software framework that can be used for the evaluation of the robustness of Malware Detection methods with respect to adversarial attacks. Currently, there is a focus on black-box adversarial attacks on PE malware detector.

The high level architecture of the software framework is shown in the following figure.

## Attacks included

* **GAMMA**, formulated by [Demetrio et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13526), with section injection and API injection manipulations. This implementation of the attack is easily used against any target model by implementing only the specific wrapper. Some code is reused from the open-source repository [secml-malware](https://github.com/pralab/secml_malware).
* **GAMMA V2**, introducted in this framework. Is an augmented version of GAMMA that optimize the section injection position, the section characteristics and the section names.

## Installation
The library requires **Python 3.8**. This limitation is mainly due to the fact that the version of the LIEF library used is not compatible with later versions of Python.

You can install the library by using the following command.
```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ ml_pentest 
```
